I work at the University of Oxford's [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) as a lecturer (assistant professor) in Artificial Intelligence, Government, and Policy and as Course Director for the [Social Science of the Internet](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-science-of-the-internet/) MSc program. 

At Oxford, I carry out research that creates new understanding into how emerging technologies (like AI) are transforming our geopolitics, states, governments, societies, and power.

The results of this research have been published in leading academic journals and conferences, informed policy at the national and supranational levels, and assisted organizations drive new digital transformation initiatives.
